# Sprites demo
Hi! I hope you will enjoy this diy sprites demo. To see a working example, https://drew-sarette.github.io/sprites-demo/

To finish it yourself, first create a spritesheet following the instructions in the img folder. Then, style the .houseplant class in the css file, so that the page displays correctly at first. Then complete the houseplant.js file, adding to style.css when needed.

Happy coding!

P. S.: If you have time, you might try making it work with an img tag for the flower in the html. (its possible, but not easy). Also, you could extend the functionality and interactivity if you store the flowerHealth in a globally available object with other properties and methods.
